					The control and motion planning of bioinspired swimming robots is complicated by the fluid–robot interaction, 
					which is governed by a very high (infinite)-dimensional nonlinear system. 
					Many high-dimensional nonlinear systems, often have low-dimensional attractors. 
					From the perspective of swimming robots, such low-dimensional attractors simplify the analysis of the mechanics 
					of swimming and prove to be useful to design controllers. This paper describes such a low-dimensional model for 
					the swimming of a class of robots that are propelled by the motion of an internal reaction wheel. The model of 
					swimming on a low-dimensional attractor is itself motivated by recent work on the dissipative Chaplygin sleigh, 
					a well-known nonholonomic system, that exhibits limit cycle dynamics. We show that the governing equations of the 
					Chaplygin sleigh are a very useful surrogate model for the swimming robot. The Chaplygin sleigh model is used to 
					demonstrate certain maneuvers by the robot through computations. Experiments with such a robot provide evidence 
					of limit cycle dynamics. Computational models based on discrete-point vortex–body interaction confirm this behavior. 
					Our work also suggests that there is a close phenomenological and mathematical similarity between the dynamics of
					swimming robots and those of ground-based nonholonomic robots, which could motivate the development of very 
					low-dimensional mathematical models for the motion of other fish-like swimming robots.<br />

				It is known that the passive mechanics of fish appendages play a role in the high efficiency of their swimming. 
				A well-known example of this is the experimental demonstration that a dead fish could swim upstream [1]. 
				However, little is known about the role if any of passive deformations of a fishlike body that could aid in 
				its maneuverability. Part of the difficulty investigating this lies in clearly separating role of actuated body 
				deformations and passive deformations in response to the fluid structure interaction. In this paper, we compare 
				the maneuverability of several fish-shaped robotic models that possess varying numbers of passive appendages 
				with a fish-shaped robot that has no appendages. All the robots are propelled by the oscillations of an internal 
				momentum wheel thereby eliminating any active deformations of the body. Our experiments clearly reveal the 
				significant improvement in maneuverability of robots with passive appendages. In the broader context of swimming 
				robots, our experiments show that passive mechanisms could be useful to provide mechanical feedback that can 
				help maneuverability and obstacle avoidance along with propulsive efficiency.<br />

				The video above shows test results from experiments with four different robots performing a turn after reaching a set speed. The robot in the top left has no passive
				tails, the top right has one passive tail and the two on the bottom both have two passive tails. The bottom right robot's tails are smaller and so they have a larger
				potential rotation range than the bottom left robot. It is clear from the video that the larger potential rotation range of the passive tail(s) the further the robot
				can turn given the same input.

			<p  id="Tmech1">
				Unmanned aquatic vehicles and robots are of
				tremendous importance in a variety of applications. In this
				paper, we present the model of an underactuated aquatic
				robot that is propelled by an internal rotor. The propulsion
				of the robot is based on the exchange of momentum between the body and water that is mediated by the creation
				of vorticity at the trailing edge of the robot. The robot does
				not have any external fins, propellers, or articulated joints
				allowing for very easy fabrication. Experimental data on its
				locomotion and maneuverability are presented.<br />
