			<p class="vids" id="NonLine">
				The control and motion planning of bioinspired swimming robots is complicated by the fluid–robot interaction, 
				which is governed by a very high (infinite)-dimensional nonlinear system. 
				Many high-dimensional nonlinear systems, often have low-dimensional attractors. 
				From the perspective of swimming robots, such low-dimensional attractors simplify the analysis of the mechanics 
				of swimming and prove to be useful to design controllers. This paper describes such a low-dimensional model for 
				the swimming of a class of robots that are propelled by the motion of an internal reaction wheel. The model of 
				swimming on a low-dimensional attractor is itself motivated by recent work on the dissipative Chaplygin sleigh, 
				a well-known nonholonomic system, that exhibits limit cycle dynamics. We show that the governing equations of the 
				Chaplygin sleigh are a very useful surrogate model for the swimming robot. The Chaplygin sleigh model is used to 
				demonstrate certain maneuvers by the robot through computations. Experiments with such a robot provide evidence 
				of limit cycle dynamics. Computational models based on discrete-point vortex–body interaction confirm this behavior. 
				Our work also suggests that there is a close phenomenological and mathematical similarity between the dynamics of
				swimming robots and those of ground-based nonholonomic robots, which could motivate the development of very 
				low-dimensional mathematical models for the motion of other fish-like swimming robots.<br />

			<p class="vids" id="Tmech2">
				It is known that the passive mechanics of fish appendages play a role in the high efficiency of their swimming. 
				A well-known example of this is the experimental demonstration that a dead fish could swim upstream [1]. 
				However, little is known about the role if any of passive deformations of a fishlike body that could aid in 
				its maneuverability. Part of the difficulty investigating this lies in clearly separating role of actuated body 
				deformations and passive deformations in response to the fluid structure interaction. In this paper, we compare 
				the maneuverability of several fish-shaped robotic models that possess varying numbers of passive appendages 
				with a fish-shaped robot that has no appendages. All the robots are propelled by the oscillations of an internal 
				momentum wheel thereby eliminating any active deformations of the body. Our experiments clearly reveal the 
				significant improvement in maneuverability of robots with passive appendages. In the broader context of swimming 
				robots, our experiments show that passive mechanisms could be useful to provide mechanical feedback that can 
				help maneuverability and obstacle avoidance along with propulsive efficiency.<br />

			<p class="vids" id="Tmech1">
				Unmanned aquatic vehicles and robots are of
				tremendous importance in a variety of applications. In this
				paper, we present the model of an underactuated aquatic
				robot that is propelled by an internal rotor. The propulsion
				of the robot is based on the exchange of momentum between the body and water that is mediated by the creation
				of vorticity at the trailing edge of the robot. The robot does
				not have any external fins, propellers, or articulated joints
				allowing for very easy fabrication. Experimental data on its
				locomotion and maneuverability are presented.<br />
